      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this section I am practicing the workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
        I am going to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create 
        low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen size, and build 
        a responsive website based on those prototypes</p>
      <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <p>I have chosen to redesign the website <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?17301932-GUDfh">when2meet</a> 
          which is a tool that helps individuals participating in the same event to find a time that works for all 
          parties. Below is an image of what the current website looks like and what some of its 
          functionalities are.</p>
        <div class="column-img-container">
          <img class="original" src="assets/original_website1.png" alt="Original Website State 1">
          <br>
          <img class="original" src="assets/original_website2.png" alt="Original Website State 2">
        </div>
        <p>I have chosen this website because it is something I have used frequently in the past and 
        didn’t have the best user experience with. </p>
        <p>
        I have analyzed the website to identify current problems based on three aspects which are usability,
        learnability, and memorability. Usability is how well the website has been designed so that users 
        can easily operate the functions and tools that the website provides. Learnability is the ability of
        first-time users to learn the website and the entire process of using the tools from start to finish. 
        Memorability is the ability of users to remeber the entire process of using the website. 
        </p>
        <h3> Usability</h3>
          <p>The website lacks affordances that make using the tool intuitive to first-time users. Instructions 
        are dispersed on the website and not provided in an organized way. The main calendar elements on the 
        website are not responsive to changes in the size of the screen. This makes the calendars difficult 
        to use when the screen becomes more narrow. The sign-in input boxes are not responsive for mobile 
        users and they are extremely hard to select and type text into. Mobile users can’t view both their 
        personal availability and group availability calendars without having to zoom out because the orientation 
        of the calendars is the exact same as desktop view. Once the mobile user zooms out on the calendars 
        it becomes almost impossible to select slots and operate because the calendars get smaller. The images below
        illustrate the problems with usability that are identified.</p>
        <div class="column-img-container">
          <img class="problems" src="assets/usabilityProblem1.png" alt="Original Website State 1">
          <br>
          <img class="problems" src="assets/usabilityProblem2.jpeg" alt="Original Website State 2">
        </div>
        <h3>Learnability</h3>
          <p>The user is exposed to all of the tools on the interface at once which results in an information overload. 
        As a result, users are hindered from learning how to operate the interface correctly. The instructions are 
        also presented in an informal manner that makes it easy to miss and ignore.</p>
        <h3>Memorability</h3>
          <p>The process of using the interface is simple and there are not a lot of steps in the entire process.
        However the poor learnability makes it harder to comprehend the entire process so an improvement in 
        learnability could also lead to a higher meorability of users.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>Apart from the three usability guidelines we are also concerned about the accessibility of the website for 
        those that require addittional features to use the website's functionality. The WebAIM Wave assessment showed 
        that there were two input boxes that didn’t have labels or corresponding descriptions of their purpose. This 
        stood out to me the most because these two inputs were extremely important to the functionality of the website.
         To accommodate screen reader users there must be a description that details the use of these two inputs. Another 
         error was related to the usability of the calendar to both mouse and keyboard users. It doesn’t seem like it is 
         too user-friendly for keyboard users. </p>

      <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>To aid my redesing of the website I have created a couple of visual redesigns to help me address the problems
          that I have identified above. </p>
        <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>
          <p>A low-fidelity wireframe is a rough sketch for the layout of my redeisng. I have decided to create 3 wireframes
            each representing one of the three common screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet). In the wireframes I have also
            added my own annotations to address the problems I am trying to fix with each new element.
          </p>
          <p>For each screen size I have created two wireframes to represent the two states that I am proposing. The initial
            state is a pop-up window that helps the user sign in and the second state is the main webpage with the calendars
            that users can choose their time slots.</p>
          <h4>Low-fidelity wireframe for desktop</h4>
            <div class="column-img-container">
              <img class="original"src="assets/desktopWireframe1.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <img class="original"src="assets/desktopWireframe2.png" alt="">
            </div>

          <h4>Low-fidelity wireframe for mobile</h4>
          <div class="column-img-container">
            <img class="original"src="assets/mobileWireframe.png" alt="">
          </div>

          <h4>Low-fidelity wireframe for tablet</h4>
          <div class="column-img-container">
            <img class="original"src="assets/tabletWireframe1.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <img class="original"src="assets/tabletWireframe2.png" alt="">
          </div>

        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
          <p>A visual design style guide displays the main colors, typography, and reusable components' different
              states (buttons on hover, click, etc.).</p>
            <div class="column-img-container">
              <img class="original"src="assets/visualDesignGuide.png" alt="">
            </div>

        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
          <p>High-fidelity prototypes are based on my low-fidelity wireframes I created but is more detailed. I will create
            three different prototypes that is responsive between different screen sizes. In my high-fidelity prototypes
            I have included annotationsof the different elements so that a developer would be able to reproduce them.</p>
            <h4>High-fidelity prototype for desktop</h4>
            <div class="column-img-container">
              <img class="original"src="assets/prototypeDesktop1.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <img class="original"src="assets/prototypeDesktop2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <h4>High-fidelity prototype for mobile</h4>
            <div class="column-img-container">
              <img class="original"src="assets/prototypeMobile.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <h4>High-fidelity prototype for tablet</h4>
            <div class="column-img-container">
              <img class="original"src="assets/prototypeTablet.png" alt="">
            </div>

      <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>For my redesign I have decided to focus on the responsiveness of the elements on the page to improve usability and
          adding an extra pop-up window to have instructions formatted in a more centralized way and to declutter the content
          on the main page. When the site is first loaded the pop-up automatically appears and prompts the reader to sign in,
          instructions are also written to help the reader. After the reader has signed in they can interact with the calendar
          (which are images in this case so it is not actually interactive) and pick their desired time slots. The design of the 
          new website also supports different screen views and should also be easily usable from those views.</p>
